# Define myself
I am a person who:

- like to learn things **interesting** and do things **meaningful**.
- is **always confident** about my ability.
- is not afraid of high work load and challenging tasks.

For me interesting things have a wide range, including my major related chemistry, chemical engineering, and physics, mathematics, philosophy, and my hobbies like music(from rock to classical, as well as singing and musical instruments), animes, drawing as well as programming.
As 'meaningful', for example, to publish papers in top journals is never my purpose, although papers play an important role when I need to find a job or position in the future.
Which is really meaningful to me is the knowledge I learned, the phenomena I found, and the skills I got in research.
Doing good science, by the way getting some papers with corresponding level is what I like to do in a chemical engineering PhD program.

# Personal
So let me start with my personal reasons. I will not judge anyone else here but only talk about myself.

I am confident about my ability. I **never** think that I am a 'bad student' who 'don't commit to research'.
Many evidences can support this, such as my grades and already published papers.
If I want to do something, I just want do it well. That is my logic.
Everyone might has his own bottom lines.
I cannot bear that my ability is always doubted by others just from things like some failed experiments which are not specific for me.

I have taken care of our chemical and instruments parts storage for years.
Also other people have their own responsibility such as person A for lab A, person B for lab B, person C for office.
But actually I take care of almost everything, such as finding office supplies and instrument parts, and contacting instrument company to get repair/maintain information.
This is not a problem at all.
Problem is that I am **always** the one be blamed.
For example, once I was asked to temporally stop my project and synthesize a compound for the other one.
This synthesis need some ether but ether has run out.
So I was blamed strictly for letting such case happen.
But in fact on the one hand I didn't know who run out ether, no people told me that.
On the other hand, I had asked for more ether few weeks before and I didn't know the order was postponed.
So in the end, few days later we got double ordered ether.

Finally, I get the conclusion that I may not be match with this group's style.

The direct reason, which lead me to make final decision, is that I was blamed strictly because I did not check enough times to get a package on the day it arrived.

I checked online on 3:40PM it did not arrive. Finally it arrived at 4:05PM. Because stock room close at around 4:00PM, I failed to get it on the same day.
And for this, I was doubted 'cannot handle PhD', 'waste our time', and be suggested 'leave early'.

# Academic
I treat my experiment data and knowledge seriously. I don't want to say much at this point about my previous group.

For example, I still have question about X-ray diffraction figure in my fist paper.
The data should be correct but do not match previous published explanation.
I doubt if previous paper has some wrong explanation because after calculation I find two data match, but crystal index and stacking ways I get are slightly different with before. 
In the end, I was suggested following previous paper to avoid trouble.

And for almost all of this summer, I was just asked to do experiments somehow like mix a dye in glue, then test its properties under UV, on the condition that the dye characterization had not been finished (unclear about its properties enough and if it is suitable for making down-conversion LED).
I don't think this is meaningful or a good way to do research.
Furthermore, I was asked to try different glues.
Some of the glue apparently would not work, but I was not allowed to stop trying those.
So in fact, I repeated some exactly same experiments again and again.
Also, to know the test details of LED device, I checked the manual of Keithley 2400 and Newport 1835-C, and guides of GPIB interface and SCPI command programming.
This took about one week. And then I was doubted 'sit there and do nothing for weeks'.

I don't say this style of research not good. Just personally, I don't like it very much.

# Future
Things happened and I need to go forward. Now seems that I have 3 ways to go after getting MS degree.

- Find another group and continue my PhD program at FSU.
- Apply for another school, in different field, say computer science related majors.
- Go back China and find other things to do.

I love my life anyway. Thanks for that I have a lot of interests, no matter in which field, I think I can find many new possibilities in the near future.
