## Hello everyone! This is my first post.

In this post, I will teach you how to make a website just like this one using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com).
Even if you know nothing about how to write a webpage, it will only take few minutes.
In fact, I am also a green hand and not familiar with everything of Jekyll, but let's study together.

First, you could go to [Burela's House-O-Blog](https://davidburela.wordpress.com/2015/11/28/easily-install-jekyll-on-windows-with-3-command-prompt-entries-and-chocolatey/)
to find the easily way to install Jekyll by [Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/).
Follow his steps and it only takes 2 steps.

Then in command prompt use *jekyll new blog* to creat a new project or just fork this project at Github. After going into the folder (*cd blog*), use *jekyll serve* to start the service.

Open your browser, type in http://localhost:4000/, press Enter and that's it!

You may notice this is just a rewrite of Burela's method. I post this just for a review of the contents myself.

## This line is for the demonstration of catalog.

Have a good day!
