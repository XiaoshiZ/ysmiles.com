First, I'd like to say that the following are all my own opinions (except for the emails part), the reader can choose to **believe or not**.

As a previous group member, I'd like to state that this paper (I have a version downloaded on 2/27/2017 at [arXiv][paperlink]) might have used data collected by me without provide me any credit.
Also, because I know details about some of the experiments, I'd like to point out some problem/doubt about the data.

### Problem data
For example, about 400 cd/m^2 mentioned in the end, this data has some problem.
If you are an editor of some scientific magazine, please just ask them the details about data collection and result calculation.
How to calculate and set the lambda setting value for the photometer?
How to calibrate the photodiode?
How to process the measurement?
What is the exact photocurrent?
How to convert the current into luminance (this name should be used rather than "brightness" to refer to cd/m^2)?
When doing calculation, what exact area of light to use?
What is the base LED model?
What is the exact ligting area of the base LED?
I am not editor, but according to my measurement and calculation, it should be far more less than 400 (strictly, less than 100). 400 should not be a reasonable number of this.

Another example is Fig. 3D. This figure is meaningless.
I collected the original raw data (will show at next section) and the Y axis unit was "human made".
Also the ralative intensity was made, if I like, I could get the data of 11 mA higher than 12 mA.
In the end, eventhough I used fixed position, the whole measurement was not reliable.

### Data I collected
Though we can see from next section the professor claims that someone else redone all of the experiments, I still found the pattern extremely similar.
I just put my version of Fig. 3B and 3D as well as some specific lines with raw data. (Actually I have all raw data.)
I think even someone redo these experiments, the result could not be exactly same. (Or eventhough that were the truth, I should still have credit.)
Fig. 3C results should also come from those data.
**Anyway I have raw data, and keep every email in record in which I sent the data to the group members.**

I think the extend Fig. 10 data should also collected by me. And nomalized output is totally meanningless.

### Emails
Just post the real emails here witout judgement about any words.

I sent an email to claim my authorship or ask for removing of the data.
```
Dear Dr. XXX,

Congratulations for the recent paper on arXiv, “Highly Luminescent Bulk Quantum Materials Based
on Zero-Dimensional Organic Tin Halide Perovskites”. 

However, I noticed this paper had taken some data collected by me, without adding my name. So this
email is a request for removing those data or adding my name in the author list. If you forgot it,
please add me in. Or if you think the contribution is so tiny that cannot be taken into account, please
remove them.

Thanks very much. Now I am not in this field and don’t care one more or one less paper, but I still
have some academic self-esteem.

Best regards,
YYY

I get the reply.

What a surprising email again! No data is "your data", as you were a research assistant in my lab
and everything was paid by my fund including your tuition, your salary, and all the expenses.
Everything you have done in my lab belongs to my lab. Asking me to remove my lab data from our paper,
you got to be kidding me. You simplify do not deserve the authorship!
Also ZZZ has redone all those measurements.  

XXX

Here is my reply to the one above.
```
Dear Dr. XXX,

Thanks for replying me and sharing your thoughts.
I never claim that anything belongs to me. 
Also I am not kidding, the last email is a formal request.
If you think I don't deserve that, I am OK and have nothing to complain to you.

I won't sent anymore email. Sorry for the bothering.

Best regards,
YYY
```

Note here that I am OK only with how does he thought of me.
I am not OK at all about what happened.
